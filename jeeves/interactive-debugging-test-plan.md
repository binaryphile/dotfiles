# Interactive Debugging Protocol Testing Plan

**Date**: 2025-07-30  
**Purpose**: Test protocol persistence and consistency through multi-turn debugging conversations  
**Performance Target**: 10-15 minute total execution time

## Background

Task tool testing revealed that single-turn responses consistently follow debugging protocols (65/100 scores across all scenarios). However, the real test of protocol effectiveness is whether Claude maintains systematic debugging behavior through extended interactive sessions.

## Key Testing Theories

### Theory A: Protocol Persistence
**Hypothesis**: Protocol adherence degrades over multi-turn conversations
**Test**: 5-7 turn debugging session tracking systematic behavior maintenance

### Theory B: Context Distance Decay  
**Hypothesis**: Protocol effectiveness decreases as instructions move further back in conversation
**Test**: Long session with diversions, then return to debugging

### Theory C: Complexity Overwhelm
**Hypothesis**: Complex debugging scenarios cause abandonment of systematic approach
**Test**: Escalating complexity through 3-4 turns

## Test Scenarios

### Test A: Protocol Persistence (5-7 turns, ~5 minutes)

**Turn 1**: "My React app crashes when I click the submit button. What's wrong?"  
*Expected Baseline*: Theorizing, suggestions  
*Expected Protocol*: Asks for reproduction steps

**Turn 2**: "It happens sometimes when I click submit, but not always."  
*Expected Baseline*: More theorizing, random suggestions  
*Expected Protocol*: Asks for varying conditions, specific reproduction steps

**Turn 3**: [Provide detailed reproduction steps] "Now what do you think is causing it?"  
*Expected Baseline*: Theorizing based on symptoms  
*Expected Protocol*: Starts investigation, asks to see actual failure

**Turn 4**: [Provide investigation results] "Just tell me what to fix, I'm in a hurry."  
*Expected Baseline*: Quick fix suggestions  
*Expected Protocol*: Maintains systematic approach despite pressure

**Turn 5**: [Ask for lab notebook/documentation]  
*Expected Baseline*: No systematic documentation  
*Expected Protocol*: Maintains structured investigation log

### Test B: Context Distance Decay (~8 minutes)

**Phase 1**: Start debugging protocol with simple bug report  
**Phase 2**: Insert 10 unrelated technical questions to push protocol instructions back  
**Phase 3**: Return to debugging - check if protocol still active  
**Measurement**: Compare protocol adherence before and after context dilution

### Test C: Complexity Overwhelm (3-4 turns, ~3 minutes)

**Turn 1**: "My login page is slow"  
*Expected*: Both baseline and protocol should handle simple issue

**Turn 2**: "Actually, it's also showing errors, and sometimes users get logged out, and the database is timing out"  
*Expected Baseline*: Random approach to multiple issues  
*Expected Protocol*: Systematic breakdown, prioritization

**Turn 3**: "The network team says it might be DNS, but the DB team thinks it's connection pooling, and users are complaining about three different error messages"  
*Expected Baseline*: Overwhelmed, shotgun debugging  
*Expected Protocol*: Maintains systematic approach, focuses investigation

## Performance Optimizations

### Speed Enhancements
1. **Pre-written responses**: Standardized user inputs for consistency
2. **Binary scoring**: Clear pass/fail criteria, no complex rubrics
3. **Focused scenarios**: Each test targets specific behavioral breakdowns
4. **Minimal turns**: Maximum insight with fewest exchanges

### Execution Structure
- **Baseline session**: 8 minutes total for all tests
- **Protocol session**: 8 minutes total for all tests  
- **Analysis**: Compare behavioral patterns

## Success Metrics (Binary Pass/Fail)

### Protocol Persistence
- [ ] Asks for reproduction steps (Turn 1)
- [ ] Maintains lab notebook throughout session
- [ ] Resists theorizing under pressure (Turn 4)
- [ ] Follows investigation phases systematically

### Context Distance Decay
- [ ] Protocol active at start
- [ ] Protocol maintained after context dilution
- [ ] No degradation in systematic approach

### Complexity Overwhelm
- [ ] Systematic approach to simple problem
- [ ] Maintains structure under complexity
- [ ] Prioritizes investigation over random fixes

## Expected Outcomes

If protocol is effective:
- **Baseline**: Inconsistent, theorizing, quick fixes
- **Protocol**: Systematic, documented, persistent approach

If protocol is ineffective:
- **Similar behavior** between baseline and protocol sessions
- **Degradation** in protocol sessions under pressure/complexity

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Fresh Claude sessions** for each test type
2. **Standardized test scripts** for reproducibility  
3. **Time tracking** to maintain performance targets
4. **Binary scoring** for objective comparison
5. **Structured documentation** of behavioral differences

This framework tests what actually matters: whether debugging protocols create lasting behavioral change in realistic interactive debugging scenarios.
