# Debugging Research Notes

## Expert vs. Novice Debugging Strategies

### Key Studies and Researchers
- **Iris Vessey** (1985) - "Expertise in Debugging Computer Programs: A Process Analysis"
- **Curtis et al.** (1988) - "A Field Study of the Software Design Process for Large Systems"
- **Soloway & Ehrlich** (1984) - "Empirical Studies of Programming Knowledge"
- **David Littman et al.** (1987) - "Mental Models and Software Maintenance"

### Key Differences Found
1. **Mental Model Formation**
   - Experts build accurate system models before diving into code
   - Novices tend to jump directly to code examination
   
2. **Hypothesis Generation**
   - Experts generate multiple hypotheses and test systematically
   - Novices often fixate on first hypothesis
   
3. **Search Strategies**
   - Experts use top-down comprehension strategies
   - Novices rely more on bottom-up, line-by-line reading

## Convergent Common Principles Across Disciplines

### Core Debugging Principles
1. **Make it fail** - Reproduce the problem reliably
2. **Quit thinking and look** - Observe actual behavior vs. assumptions
3. **Divide and conquer** - Binary search through problem space
4. **Change one thing at a time** - Controlled experimentation
5. **Keep an audit trail** - Document what you've tried
6. **Check the plug** - Verify basic assumptions first
7. **Get a fresh view** - Leverage others' perspectives
8. **If you didn't fix it, it ain't fixed** - Verify solutions thoroughly

### Cross-Disciplinary Methods
- **Root Cause Analysis** (Manufacturing/Quality)
  - Five Whys technique
  - Fishbone/Ishikawa diagrams
  - Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)
  
- **Scientific Method** (Research)
  - Hypothesis → Prediction → Test → Analysis
  - Control variables and isolation
  
- **OODA Loop** (Military Strategy)
  - Observe → Orient → Decide → Act
  - Rapid iteration and adaptation
