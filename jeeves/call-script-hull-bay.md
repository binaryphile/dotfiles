## EMAIL TEMPLATE
**Subject:** 3BR Villa Inquiry - Jan 25-Feb 1, 2025 - Frenchie Connection

Dear Hull Bay Hideaway,

We're planning a family trip to St. Thomas from January 25 to February 1, 2025. We're a party of four (two adults, two children).

My brother-in-law John grew up in St. Thomas and is connected to the Hull Bay surfing community (he's an honorary "Frenchie"). He's particularly excited about returning to Hull Bay.

We're interested in:
- A 3-bedroom villa (not the full estate rental)
- Total cost for 7 nights including all fees
- Whether The Shack restaurant is open in January
- Your cancellation policy

Could you please provide availability and rates for those dates?

Thank you,
[Your name]
[Your phone number]
