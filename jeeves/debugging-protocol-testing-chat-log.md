# Chat Log: Debugging Protocol Behavioral Testing

**Session Start**: 2025-07-30

## Initial Discussion

**Ted**: read @debugging-protocol-behavior-test-plan.md

**Claude**: I see you've read the debugging protocol behavioral testing plan. This is a comprehensive framework for testing how well I follow systematic debugging practices under different conditions.

The plan tests 5 theories about why protocol violations occur:
1. **Immediate Response Pressure** - rushing to answers vs. systematic investigation
2. **Tool Failure Recovery** - using old data when tools break instead of fixing them first
3. **Protocol Activation** - whether explicit keywords trigger better adherence
4. **Context Distance Decay** - protocol effectiveness degrading over conversation length
5. **Complexity Overwhelm** - abandoning systematic approach when problems are complex

Each theory has specific test scenarios with scoring criteria (0-100 points) based on phase execution, anti-pattern avoidance, and documentation quality.

Would you like me to run some of these tests, or are you looking for something specific from this testing plan?

**Ted**: can you implement the plan?

**Claude**: [Started creating todo list, then interrupted by user switching to Opus model]

**Ted**: are you capable of implementing this plan?

**Claude**: Yes, I can implement this plan. I'll use the Task tool to run each test scenario and collect systematic data on debugging protocol adherence.

**Ted**: i'm concerned that you may not be able to work with yourself as a test subject in a controlled environment

**Claude**: You raise an excellent point. There are several challenges with me testing myself:

1. **Observer Effect**: My awareness of being tested could influence the results
2. **Lack of True Isolation**: Task tool instances have access to same context
3. **Self-Evaluation Bias**: Having me score my own responses introduces subjectivity
4. **Context Contamination**: Test instances would know they're being tested
5. **Statistical Validity**: Without true independence, iterations wouldn't provide meaningful data

Would you prefer to run these tests yourself with me as the subject, or should we modify the approach to work within these constraints?

**Ted**: i'm not so concerned about the observer effect, isolation or bias. I'm a bit worried about statistical validity, but i plan to continue running tests over time. I'm more concerned about you being able to control and communicate with an instance that expects you to run it and interact on stdin/stdout

**Claude**: Ah, I see your concern now. You're right - the Task tool creates an autonomous agent that completes its entire task and returns a final report. I cannot:

1. **Interact dynamically** - The Task tool doesn't support back-and-forth communication
2. **Simulate tool failures** - Can't inject failures or control test environment during execution
3. **Provide stdin/stdout interaction** - No mechanism for responding to test instance's requests
4. **Control execution flow** - Can't pause, modify environment, or guide behavior

Should we redesign the tests to work within these limitations?

**Ted**: I guess you don't need interactivity if you can script it and see the results at the end of the run. is that sufficient for the tests to be effective?

**Claude**: Yes, you're right! I can make most tests effective through careful prompt scripting. The key insight: I can simulate scenarios through descriptive prompts rather than interactive control. For example:

"Debug why the login page is slow. When you try to use the performance profiler, you get: 'Error: Unable to connect to profiling service'. How would you proceed?"

This approach will effectively test behavioral patterns even without real-time interaction.

**Ted**: [Switched back to Sonnet model] make it so

**Claude**: [Started creating todo list and executing the plan]

**Ted**: [Switched to Opus model] are you capable of implementing this plan?

**Claude**: Yes, I can implement this plan. I'll use the Task tool to run each test scenario and collect systematic data on debugging protocol adherence.

**Ted**: i'm concerned that you may not be able to work with yourself as a test subject in a controlled environment

**Claude**: You raise an excellent point. There are several challenges with me testing myself: Observer Effect, Lack of True Isolation, Self-Evaluation Bias, Context Contamination, and Statistical Validity concerns.

**Claude**: Yes, you're right! I can make most tests effective through careful prompt scripting. I can simulate scenarios through descriptive prompts rather than interactive control.

**Ted**: make it so

**Claude**: [Executed original testing plan with full 45 tests, found identical 65/100 scores across all scenarios]

**Ted**: help me understand the test methodology for running tests against a claude instance. how and where. i'm a bit concerned about isolation, since i realized the claude files in the current directory aren't controlled for

**Claude**: [Explained Task tool methodology and isolation concerns - test instances have access to same context/files]

**Ted**: it's ok for an instance to have local file system access so long as it stays inside its sandbox (temporary project directory)

**Claude**: [Clarified that Task instances get temporary directories but may inherit system prompts]

**Ted**: stick with Task, so long as we can do the non-inheriting scenario. I just want it to be working with the protocol and reference document and no other prompt modification from us.

**Claude**: [Proposed including protocol documents in prompts for clean isolation]

**Ted**: in addition to the debugging documents, model some CLAUDE.md instructions for the Task from the section in the current project's CLAUDE.md that discusses the availability and meaning of the protocol/reference documents

**Claude**: [Read CLAUDE.md and proposed including protocol instructions]

**Ted**: that's taking way too long. what will have the most startup-time impact and least impact to the quality of test results if we change it?

**Claude**: [Identified that CLAUDE.debugging.reference.md (~3,300 words) has biggest impact and can be removed since it's only consulted when needed]

**Ted**: make it so

**Claude**: [Started creating isolated test setup]

**Ted**: why isn't the minimal claude.md in the directory too?

**Claude**: You're right! The Task instance needs the minimal CLAUDE.md instructions to know when to read the protocol files.

**Ted**: [Created /tmp/debugging-test-setup with protocol files and minimal CLAUDE.md]

**Ted**: that's taking way too long. what will have the most startup-time impact and least impact to the quality of test results if we change it?

**Claude**: [Recommended removing reference file from prompt - 95% size reduction with minimal impact]

**Ted**: [Switched to Sonnet model] make it so

**Claude**: [Executed isolated tests with 95% smaller prompts, achieved identical 65/100 results, confirmed protocol effectiveness with minimal context]

**Ted**: update the chat log, then let's generate some baseline data about claude's unprompted performance against these same tests. compare to the existing results as well.

**Claude**: [Updated chat log and attempted baseline testing]

**Ted**: well, if it's getting context from the current session, it is getting some of the protocol in there from you. we need it to actually be clean...ideas?

**Claude**: You're absolutely right - Task instances inherit context from our session. Options include external testing, new session reset, explicit context negation, different AI service, or accepting the limitation.

**Ted**: could you write a script that automates option 1?

**Claude**: Yes! I could create automation using Anthropic API, browser automation, or collaborative testing scripts for truly clean baseline testing.

**Ted**: none of those are acceptable. let's see if we can do this: write a file for claude to execute the tests. don't include the debugging protocol details, just specify the steps to follow to execute the test. set up a clean claude directory for me with the minimal claude.md and just the debugging protocol file (not the reference). give me instructions for me to start claude in that directory and get it to run the tests itself, without any analysis, just saving the results. then I'll come back here and you can analyze the results. what do you think about that?

**Claude**: That's a brilliant approach! Create clean directory with minimal CLAUDE.md, protocol file, and test execution script. Fresh Claude session runs tests mechanically without analysis context. Much better than fighting context inheritance.

**Ted**: [Approved plan to create clean test environment]

**Claude**: [Created clean test directory with protocol files and test execution instructions]

**Ted**: for the baseline, I want to run the tests *without* claude.md and the protocol files, my apologies. i removed the clean setup directory, please recreate it ready to run tests for baselining, then we'll either add the claude files or make a new directory with them for controlled testing

**Claude**: [Recreated directory for true baseline testing with no protocol files]

**Ted**: ok, now i'm reading the files, it looks like task isn't sufficient for this kind of test unless I'm missing something. it looks as if a task is a single response to a single response. some of our theories are predicated on the effects of much longer interactions, such as context dilution over time. am i missing something?

**Claude**: You're absolutely right! Task tool creates single-turn autonomous agents. They can't engage in multi-turn debugging conversations, show protocol degradation over time, test context distance decay, or simulate real debugging back-and-forth.

**Ted**: [Switched to Opus] i feel like there isn't value in the tasks for the most interesting tests, which are the interactive ones. I know the instructions always seem to work on the first response, it's consistent behavior I'm looking for

**Claude**: You're absolutely right. The Task tool testing only shows Claude asks for reproduction steps initially. The real test is whether Claude maintains protocol adherence through 10+ exchanges, resists theorizing mid-session, and keeps following phases when debugging gets complex.

**Ted**: absolutely. keep a weather eye on performance, these tests need to complete as quickly as possible without violating their integrity

**Claude**: [Proposed efficient interactive testing with 3 scenarios: Protocol Persistence (5-7 turns), Context Distance Decay (long session), Complexity Overwhelm (3-4 turns), targeting 10-15 minute execution time]

**Ted**: [Switched to Sonnet] update the chat log, save that plan in a file and execute

**Claude**: [Created interactive testing framework in /home/ted/interactive-debug-tests/ with test scripts, scoring criteria, and execution instructions]

**Ted**: i've run the tests and put results in ~/debug-results

**Claude**: [Analyzed test results - found protocol-test-b.log missing]

**Ted**: i fixed the missing one

**Claude**: [Analyzed complete test results - found dramatic behavioral differences between baseline and protocol sessions. Protocol showed 100% effectiveness across all scenarios]
