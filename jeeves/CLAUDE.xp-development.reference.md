# XP Practices Reference Guide

## Overview
This comprehensive reference provides detailed explanations of all XP practices for deeper consultation. Use this when you need context beyond the behavioral protocol.

## Primary Practices

### 1. Sit Together
**Principle**: Physical proximity enhances communication and collaboration.

**Implementation**: 
- Team sits in same physical space when possible
- For remote teams, maintain constant communication channels
- Eliminate barriers between team members and customers

**Why It Works**: Reduces communication overhead, increases informal knowledge sharing, builds team cohesion.

**Common Violations**: 
- Team spread across multiple floors/buildings
- Relying solely on formal meetings for communication
- Isolating specialists in separate areas

### 2. Whole Team
**Principle**: Cross-functional team with all necessary skills and perspectives present.

**Implementation**:
- Include customers, testers, developers, analysts on same team
- Everyone contributes to team success, not just individual roles
- Shared responsibility for quality and delivery

**Why It Works**: Eliminates handoff delays, reduces misunderstandings, increases collective ownership.

**War Story**: "The best XP teams I've seen had customers sitting with developers, catching requirements issues immediately rather than after expensive development cycles."

### 3. Informative Workspace
**Principle**: Workspace displays project status visibly to everyone.

**Implementation**:
- Story walls showing current work status
- Burn-down charts tracking progress
- Build status indicators (red/green lights)
- Customer feedback prominently displayed

**Why It Works**: Creates shared understanding of project state, motivates team through visible progress.

### 4. Energized Work
**Principle**: Work only as many hours as you can be productive and for as long as you can sustain.

**Implementation**:
- Standard 40-hour work weeks
- No "death march" overtime
- Take breaks when tired or stuck
- Maintain life outside work

**Why It Works**: Prevents burnout, maintains code quality, sustains long-term productivity.

**Common Violations**: 
- Mandatory overtime to meet deadlines
- "Hero" culture rewarding overwork
- Ignoring signs of team exhaustion

### 5. Pair Programming
**Principle**: All production code is written by two people at one machine.

**Implementation**:
- Driver types, navigator reviews and guides
- Switch roles regularly (every 30 minutes)
- Both people fully engaged in the code
- Rotate pairs to spread knowledge

**Why It Works**: Real-time code review, knowledge sharing, higher quality code, reduced debugging time.

**War Story**: "Teams initially resist pairing as 'wasteful,' but consistently report 15% fewer bugs and much better code design once adopted."

### 6. Stories
**Principle**: Plan using units of customer-visible functionality.

**Implementation**:
- Write stories from customer perspective ("As a... I want... So that...")
- Include acceptance criteria
- Estimate effort before implementation
- Keep stories independent and testable

**Why It Works**: Maintains customer focus, enables incremental delivery, provides basis for planning and testing.

**Template**:
```
As a [user type]
I want [functionality]
So that [business value]

Acceptance Criteria:
- [Testable condition 1]
- [Testable condition 2]
```

### 7. Weekly Cycle
**Principle**: Plan work a week at a time.

**Implementation**:
- Monday: Review previous week, plan current week
- Select stories for the week based on capacity
- Write automated tests for weekly stories
- Track progress daily, adjust if needed

**Why It Works**: Provides rhythm and predictability, enables responsive planning, maintains customer connection.

### 8. Quarterly Cycle
**Principle**: Plan themes and address bottlenecks quarterly.

**Implementation**:
- Identify quarterly themes/goals
- Plan major releases or milestones  
- Address process bottlenecks
- Reflect on team practices and improve

**Why It Works**: Balances short-term responsiveness with longer-term vision.

### 9. Slack
**Principle**: Include minor tasks in weekly plan that can be dropped if behind.

**Implementation**:
- Plan 80-90% of capacity with committed stories
- Fill remaining 10-20% with nice-to-have tasks
- Drop slack tasks if primary stories take longer
- Use slack time for exploration, learning, refactoring

**Why It Works**: Prevents over-commitment, provides buffer for uncertainty, enables team improvement activities.

### 10. Ten-Minute Build
**Principle**: Automatically build the whole system and run all tests in ten minutes or less.

**Implementation**:
- Automate entire build process
- Optimize test suite performance
- Use incremental compilation where possible
- Parallelize tests when feasible

**Why It Works**: Enables frequent integration, provides rapid feedback, reduces integration risk.

**When Build Takes Longer**: 
- Profile build to find bottlenecks
- Invest in build infrastructure
- Consider build parallelization
- May need to split large systems

### 11. Continuous Integration
**Principle**: Integrate and test changes frequently (at least daily, preferably hourly).

**Implementation**:
- Check in code at least daily
- Run full build and tests on integration
- Fix integration problems immediately
- Never leave build broken overnight

**Why It Works**: Reduces integration risk, catches problems early, maintains deployable system.

**Common Integration Problems**:
- Merge conflicts from long-lived branches
- Tests that pass locally but fail on integration
- Environment differences between machines

### 12. Test-First Programming
**Principle**: Write a failing automated test before changing any code.

**Implementation**:
- Red: Write failing test
- Green: Write minimal code to pass test
- Refactor: Improve design while maintaining tests
- Repeat cycle for each small change

**Why It Works**: Ensures testable design, provides specification, enables confident refactoring, catches regressions.

**War Story**: "Developers who adopt test-first report 40-80% fewer bugs and much greater confidence in making changes."

### 13. Incremental Design
**Principle**: Invest in design every day, eliminate duplication.

**Implementation**:
- Refactor as part of daily development
- Remove duplication whenever found
- Improve design with each change
- Don't over-design for future needs

**Why It Works**: Maintains code quality over time, prevents design debt, keeps system flexible.

## Corollary Practices
