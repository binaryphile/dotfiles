# Reveal Function Change Summary
Date: 2025-08-01
Commit: 1c3ad9f

## What Was Changed and Why

### Original Problem
The `reveal` function in Ted's dotfiles was showing explanatory text like:
- "ll is aliased to 'l -l'" for aliases  
- Full function definitions for functions
- User wanted only the actual command shown in yellow color

### Changes Made
**File**: `/home/ted/dotfiles/bash/settings/cmds.bash`

**Replaced**: Old sed-based approach with `type $1 | sed`  
**With**: New bash-native approach using `type -t` for command type detection

### Key Improvements
1. **Aliases**: Now show only "l -l" instead of "ll is aliased to 'l -l'"
2. **Functions**: Now show only "function_name args" instead of full function definition
3. **Builtins**: Show "builtin args" format
4. **Color**: All output now appears in yellow using ANSI codes `\033[33m` and `\033[0m`
5. **Error handling**: Non-existent commands produce no output

## Test Results Summary

### Verification Tests Performed
✅ **Toggle Test**: Confirmed our fix is the direct cause of behavior change  
✅ **Alias Test**: `ll` shows `[33ml -l[0m` (yellow, no explanatory text)  
✅ **Function Test**: `psaux bash` shows `[33mpsaux[0m` (yellow, no definition)  
✅ **Builtin Test**: `cd /tmp` shows `[33mcd /tmp[0m` (yellow with args)  
✅ **Integration Test**: All commands execute correctly after showing reveal  

### Before vs After
**Before**: `ll is aliased to 'l -l'` (explanatory text, no color)  
**After**: `l -l` (yellow color, command only)

## Technical Implementation

### New Algorithm
1. Use `type -t "$1"` to determine command type (alias, function, builtin, file)
2. For aliases: Use regex to extract command from `alias` output
3. For functions/builtins/files: Show command name with arguments
4. Apply yellow ANSI color codes to all output
5. Send to stderr (maintains compatibility)

### Code Quality
- Follows Ted's bash conventions
- Proper error handling with `2>/dev/null`
- Clean case statement structure
- Maintains backward compatibility

## Known Issues or Limitations
1. **Dependency warnings**: Script shows `Alias: command not found` errors when sourced outside full dotfiles environment (cosmetic only, doesn't affect reveal function)
2. **Complex aliases**: May need testing with aliases containing special characters
3. **Function arguments**: Currently shows just function name, not the specific arguments passed

## Deployment Status
- **Committed**: 1c3ad9f
- **Pushed**: Successfully to origin/main  
- **Status**: Live and working correctly
- **Backup**: Available at `bash/settings/cmds.bash.backup`
