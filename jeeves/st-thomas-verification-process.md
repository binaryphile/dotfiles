### CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

#### What Makes Information "Verified"

✅ **VERIFIED Looks Like:**
- "Spoke with Maria at front desk on 8/31/25, she emailed quote #12345"
- "Confirmed with Google Street View dated July 2025"
- "Three recent reviews (Aug 2025) mention this"
- "Screenshot of availability taken 8/31/25 at 2pm"

❌ **UNVERIFIED Looks Like:**
- "Website says available"
- "Should be around $300/night"
- "They're usually open"
- "I read somewhere that..."

#### The Verification Call Formula

**Always Get:**
1. Name of person
2. Direct extension/email
3. Written confirmation
4. Specific date verification
5. Total price with all fees

**Always Ask:**
1. "Is that your best rate?"
2. "Are there any planned closures?"
3. "What's different in January vs summer?"
4. "What should I know that I haven't asked?"

### THE GOLDEN RULES

1. **If you didn't verify it, mark it as "unconfirmed"**
2. **Screenshot everything with timestamp**
3. **Get names, not departments**
4. **Email quotes are better than verbal**
5. **Recent reviews > official websites**
6. **When in doubt, call again**
7. **Document who decided what and why**

This process ensures your trip plan contains only real, actionable information that you can rely on, not hopeful assumptions that lead to disappointment.
