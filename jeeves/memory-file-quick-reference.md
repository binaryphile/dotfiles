- [ ] Keep memorable war stories
- [ ] Clear Claude's memory to refocus on summary prior to next step

### 2. Translate (20-30 min)

- [ ] Add checklists and decision gates
- [ ] Build documentation templates

### 3. Create Files (15-20 min)

## 🎯 Behavioral Translation Formula

```
Source: "Principle or rule from book"
↓
When [TRIGGER CONDITION], IMMEDIATELY:
1. **STOP** - [What NOT to do]
2. **DO** - [Required action]
3. **CHECK** - [Verification step]
```

## 📝 Essential Structure

```markdown
# [Topic] Behavior Protocol

## 🛑 MANDATORY STARTUP
When [trigger], IMMEDIATELY:
[3-step protocol]

## 📋 PHASES
[Actions → Gate → Next]

## 🚫 ANTI-PATTERNS  
❌ "[Wrong]" → STOP → [Right]

## 🔄 DECISIONS
[Tree structure]

## 📝 TEMPLATES
[Documentation format]
```

## ✅ Quality Checklist

- [ ] Triggers are specific and observable
- [ ] Actions use imperatives (DO, STOP, CHECK)
- [ ] Anti-patterns interrupt wrong behavior
- [ ] Gates prevent phase skipping
- [ ] Templates ensure consistent output

## 🎬 Action Words

**Strong**: STOP, IMMEDIATELY, ALWAYS, NEVER, MUST
**Weak**: Should, might, consider, try, maybe

Remember: Behavior change, not knowledge transfer!
