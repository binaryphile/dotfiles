# Reveal Function Current Behavior Testing
Date: 2025-08-01
Purpose: Document current behavior before modification

## Step 2: Alias Behavior Testing

### Test: `ll` alias without arguments
- Command run: `ll >/dev/null` (to capture stderr only)
- Exact stderr output: `ll is aliased to 'l -l'`
- Command execution: Succeeded, listed files in current directory

### Test: `type ll` (raw format)
- Output: `ll is aliased to 'reveal ll; l -l'`
- Shows the full alias definition including the `reveal ll;` prefix

## Step 3: Alias with Arguments Testing

### Test: `la /tmp >/dev/null`
- Exact stderr output: `la is aliased to 'l -la'`
- Arguments `/tmp` were passed through to the actual command
- The reveal output does NOT show the arguments, only the base command

### Test: `type la` (raw format)
- Output: `la is aliased to 'reveal la; l -la'`
- Shows full alias with `reveal la;` prefix

## Step 4: Function Behavior Testing

### Test: `type miracle`
- Output: Full function definition shown
- Function contains `reveal "$FUNCNAME";` as first line
- `$FUNCNAME` would expand to "miracle"

### Test: `type psaux`  
- Output: Full function definition shown
- Function contains `reveal "$FUNCNAME";` as first line
- Uses `"$@"` for argument handling

## Step 5: Type Command Output Analysis

### Files created:
- `type-ll-output.txt`: Contains `ll is aliased to 'reveal ll; l -l'`
- `type-miracle-output.txt`: Contains full function definition
- `type-la-output.txt`: Contains `la is aliased to 'reveal la; l -la'`

### Key patterns observed:
- Aliases: `[name] is aliased to 'reveal [name]; [actual command]'`
- Functions: `[name] is a function` followed by full definition
- The `reveal [name];` prefix is present in all alias definitions

## Step 6: Edge Cases

### Test: `type nonexistentcommand`
- Output: `/bin/bash: line 1: type: nonexistentcommand: not found`
- Error condition handled by bash itself

### Test: `type cd`
- Output: `cd is a shell builtin`
- Different format for builtin commands

## Step 7: Summary Report

### Current reveal output format for aliases:
- Format: `[alias_name] is aliased to '[actual_command]'`
- Example: `ll is aliased to 'l -l'`
- The `reveal [name];` prefix is stripped from the output by the current sed command

### Current reveal output format for functions:
- Functions show `reveal "$FUNCNAME";` in their definition
- When a function runs, it would call `reveal` with the function name
- The current `reveal` function shows the `type` output filtered through sed

### How arguments are currently handled:
- Arguments are passed through to the actual command
- Reveal output does NOT include the arguments - only shows the base alias/command
- For functions, arguments would be available as `$@`

### What text needs to be removed:
- "is aliased to '" and ending "'" for aliases
- The `reveal [name];` prefix (already being removed by current sed)
- For functions: the entire function definition should be replaced with just the function call

### Output stream confirmation:
- All reveal output goes to stderr (confirmed by `>/dev/null` tests)

## Step 8: Test Completeness Verification

- [x] Exact format of current alias reveal output: `[name] is aliased to '[command]'`
- [x] Exact format of current function reveal output: Full function definition via `type`
- [x] How the `reveal $1;` prefix appears and needs to be stripped: Present in alias definitions, already stripped by current sed
- [x] Argument handling behavior: Arguments passed to actual command, not shown in reveal output
- [x] Output stream (stderr) confirmation: Confirmed all output goes to stderr

## Key Findings for Implementation:
1. Current behavior uses `type $1 | sed` to process the output
2. For aliases: Need to extract text between "is aliased to '" and ending "'"
3. For functions: Current implementation shows full function definition - this needs to change
4. The `reveal [name];` prefix is already being stripped by the existing sed command
5. Arguments are not currently shown in reveal output - this behavior should be preserved
6. All output goes to stderr - this should be maintained
